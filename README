# This is an application which allows a user to view, filter, and analyse a .csv file for a drillhole database. 
# Whilst grammar should not matter, the user should make sure that their data contains a Hole ID column of some kind, and Depth From and Depth To columns of some kind. This allows the used to plot any other data with respect to depth. The first row should contain all the headers/fields. 
# The data should also be in good shape insofar as the input document is flat and standardised.
